    </a>
    <p>I began this zine with the help of my like-minded friend in college with the intention of updating close friends
        and family about what we were up to. However upon sharing this with my creative writing professor she offered
        funding from NYU Shanghai's Creative Writing Dept. After some negotiations about artistic freedoms and expansion
        we decided to officially start the zine.
    </p>
    <p>It was a great success among the readers, some saying how they're so glad there are students starting creative
        pursuits in a school that is generally so goal/career-oriented.

    </a>
    <p>This blog started out as a safe ranting space. I shared some pieces with some close friends and they really 
        ennjoyed it. In this creative writing I really take a very, very large step away from academic writing and allow
        myself to write whatever strong opinion I feel in a very fluid manner. It is simply meant to be entertaining at
        the end of the day.
    </p>

    <p>Along with some silly, yet strongly opinionated pieces, I also share some writings from my coursework which I 
        feel represents my voice as a genuine writer.
